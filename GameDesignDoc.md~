My game follows the adventure of a little pig who has learned how to fly. 
You control his flight with the mouse key. You left click to make him climb altitude and go higher. Holding the left click will make your pig rise. Upon releasing the left mouse clicker, your pig slowly loses altitude.
You can "shoot" missiles with the space button. 
Your pig is not alone in the sky though. There are obstacles, which are the '5 things' which he is supposed to avoid or go towards.
